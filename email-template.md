Hi there üëã,

I'm [NAME], a fellow developer and organizer of CodeNewbie Kit. CodeNewbie Kit a welcome kit for #CodeNewbies that gives them a sense of belonging and simple tools/resources to help them get their journey started. 

#CodeNewbies are often plagued by analysis paralysis with an entire web of resources. With CodeNewbie Kit #CodeNewbies will have simple tools mailed (yes, snail mail üêå) to them to get them started on the right foot. 

Talking with other self-taught devs on Twitter, I've noticed we all had a pretty rough start. Most recently, [Tyra](twitter.com/TyraEarl/status/1266404835097706496) mentioned feeling overwhelmed with all the resources and that it would be helpful to have something consolidated.

With this in mind, I asked twitter what should be included and people were super helpful with answers. There were suggestions for hot key cheat sheets, comics that show how to do pull requests, git cheat sheets, of course üòÇ stickers, and many other things. 

I think [COMPANYNAME] would really benefit from being introduced to new devs. Would you be interested in contributing/sponsoring something?

Best Regards,
Vicki Langer

- hooks me with the value ("why should I care?")
- explains how (more on this later)
- relevant social proof of the value
- *giving* something valuable *to* me, not *asking* for something *from* me
