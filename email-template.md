Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I am [name], a fellow developer and organizer of CodeNewbie Kit. CodeNewbie Kit a welcome kit for #CodeNewbies that makes them feel like they belong and gives them simple tools and resources to help them get their journey started. 

#CodeNewbies are often plagued by analysis paralysis of the entire web of resources. CodeNewbie Kit intends to put the right tools in front of them to get them started on the right foot. 


Best Regards,
Vicki Langer
Organizer, CodeNewbie-Kit

Following this concept: https://twitter.com/louisnicholls_/status/1248578404435333122
- hooks me with the value ("why should I care?")
- explains how (more on this later)
- relevant social proof of the value
- *giving* something valuable *to* me, not *asking* for something *from* me
